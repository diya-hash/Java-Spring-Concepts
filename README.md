Practical concepts on Java and SpringBoot. This repository contains all the important Spring and Java concepts. It can be used to get a basic overview of Java and Spring Framework and also, help prepare for interviews.

Important concepts of Java:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understand the four main principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Be prepared to explain and provide examples of each.

2. Java Collections Framework: Familiarize yourself with core interfaces (List, Set, Map) and classes (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap), along with concepts like generics and the difference between mutable and immutable collections.

3. Exception Handling: Know the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions, the use of try-catch blocks, and the significance of the finally block and custom exceptions.

4. Multithreading and Concurrency: Understand the basics of threads, synchronization, the Runnable interface, and concepts like locks, semaphores, and the Executor framework.

5. Java Memory Management: Learn about the Java memory model, garbage collection, heap vs. stack memory, and how memory leaks can occur.

6. Java Streams and Functional Programming: Be familiar with the Stream API introduced in Java 8, including operations like filter, map, and reduce, and concepts like lambda expressions and functional interfaces.

7. Design Patterns: Understand common design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, etc.) and their use cases in Java applications.

8. Java 8 Features: Besides streams and lambdas, know about new features such as default methods in interfaces, the Optional class, and the Date and Time API.

9. JVM and Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Know how the Java Virtual Machine works, the concept of bytecode, and the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM.

10. Testing Frameworks: Be aware of unit testing in Java, particularly using JUnit and Mockito, and understand the importance of test-driven development (TDD).

Important concepts of Spring Framework:

1. Inversion of Control (IoC): Understand the principle of IoC and how Spring manages object creation and lifecycle through the IoC container.

2. Dependency Injection (DI): Know the different types of dependency injection (constructor, setter, and field injection) and how they promote loose coupling.

3. Beans and the Application Context: Familiarize yourself with the concept of Spring beans, their scopes (singleton, prototype, etc.), and the ApplicationContext interface.

4. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Learn about AOP concepts such as cross-cutting concerns, advice, join points, and how Spring supports AOP.

5. Spring MVC: Understand the Model-View-Controller design pattern, how Spring MVC works, and key components like controllers, views, and the DispatcherServlet.

6. Spring Boot: Be aware of Spring Boot's features, such as auto-configuration, starter dependencies, and the embedded server setup, which simplifies application development.

7. Data Access: Get familiar with Springâ€™s support for JDBC, JPA (Java Persistence API), and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools like Hibernate.

8. Spring Security: Understand the basics of securing a Spring application, including authentication, authorization, and security configurations.

9. Spring Testing: Know how to write unit and integration tests in Spring using the Spring Test module and tools like JUnit and Mockito.

10. RESTful Services: Be familiar with building RESTful web services using Spring, including the use of @RestController, @RequestMapping, and response handling.
