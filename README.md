Practical concepts on Java and SpringBoot in Code                           

SOLID Principle: 
S - Single responsibility
O - Open / Closed
L - Liskov Principle
I - Inversion Control
D - Dependency Inversion

Single Responsibility: The class or Method should focus on one concept or problem. For example if a class is to focus on a circle then it should only have methods that is related to a circle. For instance, the class can have methods on calculating the radius, diamter, or the degrees of the circle but not the area of a square. When it comes to a method, it should focus on only one problem or output. So in this case, if the method is to calculate the diamater of a circle then it should only calcu;late that and not the rasdius of the circle.
